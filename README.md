# SoDMod

This is a mod for the game Shadows of Doubt. Currently it only has a couple of
features but will no doubt grow as time progresses.

## Current Features

* Fixes a bug where you still get smelly even when disabled/syncdisk installed.
* Allows you to "Edit Decor" no matter where you are.
* Allows you to "Edit Decor" for free.

All of the features are optional. Only the bugfix is enabled by default.

## Installation
Download the SoDMod DLL from the latest release on the right. You will need
[BepInEx 6.0.0-pre1](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases/tag/v6.0.0-pre.1)

Installation of BepInEx is as simple as dropping the whole thing in the root of
your game folder. You should place `SoDMod.dll` in the `BepInEx/plugins` folder.
